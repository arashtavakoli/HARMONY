# HARMONY-Welcome to HARMONY: A Human-centered Multimodal Driving Study in the Wild

In HARMONY we collect multimodal data from drivers using smart wearable devices, cameras, and multiple APIs. HARMONY paves the pave to human-centered autonomous vehicles that can understand, adapt, and respond to the human driver. In this repository you can find different scripts that I have used through my Ph.D. and while working with HARMONY dataset. For more information about HARMONY, please visit http://uvabrainlab.com/portfolio/shared-autonomy-considerations-in-autonomous-vehicles/. A Sampled ataset of HARMONY can be downloaded from https://osf.io/zextd/wiki/home/
